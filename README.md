# Living Salamanca (Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project)
## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to create a website that offers Spanish courses in the historical city of Salamanca (Spain). Salamanca has one of the oldest universities in Europe and it hosts the Spanish department where all the DELE exams are produced and marked. Also, I have added other features on the website to help to know and enjoy the city such as accommodation, what to see, eating, and shopping.
## User stories

This project has been designed with someone that is interested in learning Spanish in mind. That is our ideal end-user. The expected scope of people attending these courses is to be in the range of 18 to 30 years old.

* As an international student, I want to know the types of courses on offer and which one adapts better to my necessities
* As an international student, I will fing useful some basic information about the city such as acommodation or where to eat
* As an international student, I will like to learn about the culture of a different country and the rich history of Salamanca
