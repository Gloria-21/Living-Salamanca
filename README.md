# Living Salamanca (Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project)
## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to create a website that offers a different holidays experience learning Spanish in the historical city of Salamanca (Spain). Salamanca has one of the oldest universities in Europe and it hosts the Spanish department where all the DELE exams are produced and marked. Also, I have added other features on the website to help to know and enjoy the city such as accommodation, what to visit, eating, and shopping.
## User stories

This project has been designed with someone that is interested in learning Spanish in mind, that is our ideal end-user. The expected scope of people attending these courses is to be in the range of 18 to 30 years old.

* As an international student, I want to know the types of courses on offer and which one adapts better to my necessities
* As an international student, I will fing useful some basic information about the city such as acommodation or where to eat
* As an international student, I will like to learn about the culture of a different country and the rich history of Salamanca

## Desing

* **Logo**

    I have chosen a globe as a logo for this website as it represents the diversity of nationalities that you can find in Salamanca. Also, it represents the openness of a city that traditionally has been welcoming international students since medieval times.
    The logo for this website has been created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/play?category=tACZCvjI6mE)

* **Typography**

    The font use on the website has been chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I have chosen Lato for the Navbar and headers and Roboto for the body

* **Colour Scheme**

    The colour scheme for the website follows the Salamanca University tradition. 
    I have chosen the #beige as it is similar to the typical golden sandstone that can be found on the historical buildings in Salamanca, and the #firebrick as it is similar to the ink that you can see on those walls. What it can be seen in there is the word "Vitor" (Victory) with the students initial after they were graduated. These ink was made originally with bull's blood, hence the red color.

    For the hovering effect I decided to go for #FFB91C as it contrast quite nicely against the #firebrick

    To create this palette I have used [coolors](https://coolors.co/)
