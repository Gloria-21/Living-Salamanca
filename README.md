# Living Salamanca (Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project)
## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to create a website that offers Spanish courses in the historical city of Salamanca (Spain). Salamanca has one of the oldest universities in Europe and it hosts the Spanish department where all the DELE exams are produced and marked. Also, I have added other features on the website to help to know and enjoy the city such as accommodation, what to see, eating, and shopping.
